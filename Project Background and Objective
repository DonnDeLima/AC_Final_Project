Project Background: 

Protecting personal information from unauthorized access has become increasingly important as the world grows more digitally linked.   Cryptography is necessary for everything from protecting stored data to securing online chats in order to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of digital information.

Secure communication is made possible by cryptography, which uses algorithms to transform readable data into an unreadable one.   It is widely used in secure communications, email encryption, digital signatures, online banking, and many more everyday applications.   Professionals working in cybersecurity, software development, and IT infrastructure need to be theoretically and practically knowledgeable about cryptographic techniques.

Utilizing widely used cryptographic tools and algorithms in a single, interactive setting is important for promoting practical understanding.   This approach allows users to test encryption, decryption, and hashing on real data, providing them with a practical introduction to the principles of information security.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to design and build an interactive, user-friendly application that demonstrates the use of core cryptographic techniques. The specific goals include:
Implement core cryptographic algorithms including symmetric, asymmetric, and hashing techniques for securing text and files.


Develop an intuitive user interface using Streamlit to allow easy access to encryption, decryption, and hashing functions.


Ensure secure data processing for confidentiality, integrity verification, and password protection.
