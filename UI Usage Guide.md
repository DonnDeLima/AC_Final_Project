**üè† Home Page Overview**
The home page introduces the application and provides a summary of its main features. From the sidebar, users can navigate between three core cryptographic algorithm categories:

**üîê Symmetric Algorithms**
Users can select one of the following classic encryption methods:
- Caesar Cipher
- Vigen√®re Cipher
- Vernam Cipher

**üîë Asymmetric Algorithms**
These public-key encryption options are available:

- RSA
- Diffie-Hellman

**üß¨ Hashing Algorithms**
For secure message digest generation, users can choose from:

- SHA-1
- SHA-256
- SHA-3
- MD5

**üß≠ Step-by-Step Instructions**
1. Input:Type or paste your plain text into the input box,or upload a .txt file containing the content you wish to encrypt or hash.
2. Choose Action:For encryption/decryption algorithms, select Encrypt or Decrypt.
3. For hashing algorithms, select your desired hash function, then click to generate the hash.
4. Apply:Press Enter after entering the text or uploading the file.
5. Process:Click the Encrypt or Decrypt button to perform the operation.
6. Output:The result (either encrypted, decrypted, or hashed output) will be displayed on the screen.
7. You can then copy  the result for future reference.

**Future Enhancements**
To further improve the application, the following features are planned:
 
- UI/UX Improvements: Refine the user interface and experience to make the app more intuitive, visually appealing, and accessible for all users.
- File Download Capability: Enable users to download the output of their encryption or decryption operations as a file for easier storage and sharing.
- User Authentication System: Introduce user registration and login functionality to create personalized sessions, allowing users to securely manage and track
their encryption and decryption activities.
