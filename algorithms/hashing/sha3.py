            **🔎 What is SHA-3?**
        
            **🕰️ Brief History** 
              SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3) is the latest member of the SHA family, standardized by NIST in 2015.  
              It was designed as a backup in case SHA-2 was compromised, based on the Keccak algorithm.
        
            **🔧 How It Works**  
              SHA-3 processes input data in blocks through a sponge construction, absorbing input and squeezing out a fixed-length hash.  
              This implementation uses SHA3-256, producing a 256-bit (32-byte) hash.
        
            **🧾 Pseudocode**   
              ```
              Initialize state
              Absorb input blocks into the state with permutation
              Squeeze output hash from the state
              Return fixed-length hash digest
              ```
        
            **🧾 Pseudocode**  
              - Verifying data integrity  
              - Password hashing (with proper salting)  
              - Digital signatures  
              - Cryptographic applications requiring collision resistance
        
             **⚠️ Limitations**   
              - Not reversible (hashing is one-way)  
              - Not suitable for encryption/decryption  
              - Vulnerable if used without salting in password storage  
              - Slower than some SHA-2 variants in certain hardware setups  
              - Fixed output length (not ideal for variable-length digest needs)
