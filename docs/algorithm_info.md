
Block Cipher
A block cipher is a symmetric encryption technique that processes data in fixed-size blocks, typically 64 or 128 bits, using a single secret key for both encryption and decryption. It secures data by applying a series of complex transformation rounds to each block, making the output ciphertext significantly different from the original plaintext. This approach ensures that only those with the correct key can decrypt the data, maintaining confidentiality during storage or transmission.
Block ciphers often operate in different modes—such as ECB, CBC, CFB, and CTR—which determine how blocks are encrypted and how they relate to one another. While ECB encrypts each block independently, CBC and other chaining modes introduce dependencies between blocks to enhance security. Commonly used block cipher algorithms include AES, DES, 3DES, and Blowfish, and they are fundamental to securing communications in various applications, from file encryption to secure messaging.

RSA
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptographic algorithm developed in 1977. It is based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers—a problem that is computationally intensive and time-consuming to solve. RSA provides a secure method for encrypting and decrypting data and plays a critical role in ensuring confidentiality and authenticity in digital communications. The strength of RSA lies in its reliance on the fact that while multiplying two large primes is easy, factoring their product to retrieve the original numbers is extremely difficult with current computational power. Uses asymmetric encryption, meaning it relies on a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is made available to anyone and is used to encrypt messages intended for the key owner. The private key, on the other hand, is kept secret and used by the key owner to decrypt the received messages. This key pair is generated during the key generation phase using large prime numbers and modular arithmetic operations, forming the foundation for secure communication.
The process of RSA encryption and decryption occurs in three main stages. First, during key generation, large prime numbers are selected to create the public and private keys. Next, in the encryption stage, a sender uses the recipient’s public key to convert plaintext data into cipher text, securing the message during transmission. Finally, in the decryption stage, the recipient applies their private key to the cipher text to retrieve the original plaintext. This system ensures that even if the encrypted message is intercepted, it cannot be read without access to the private key, making RSA an essential tool in modern digital security.



Diffie-Hellman
The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a method that allows two people to create a shared secret key over a public channel, even if they have never communicated before. Each person chooses a private number and uses a public formula to create a new value, which they send to each other. When they receive the other person's value, they use their own private number to perform a calculation that results in the same shared secret key. This key can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages securely. The key itself is never sent or shared, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to figure out, even if they are watching the communication. This process allows two parties to communicate privately without needing to exchange secret information directly.

SHA-3

SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3) is the most recent addition to the SHA family, published by NIST in 2015. Unlike its predecessors SHA-1 and SHA-2, SHA-3 is built on a completely different internal structure known as the Keccak algorithm, which uses a "sponge construction" rather than the Merkle-Damgård design used by earlier SHA versions. This makes SHA-3 structurally distinct and more resilient against certain cryptographic attacks. It is designed to produce a fixed-size message digest from a variable-length input in a way that appears random, enhancing overall security. One of its notable characteristics is that its digest size is flexible, allowing for different output lengths, and its performance is comparable to SHA-256, with a speed of about 12.6 cycles per byte (cpb) on x86-64 systems, making it both secure and efficient for modern cryptographic applications.

Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar, who used it to securely communicate with his generals. It is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, the letter 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. This method transforms readable text into an unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access. To decrypt the message, the receiver simply shifts the letters in the opposite direction by the same fixed number. Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher played a significant role in early cryptography. Julius Caesar reportedly used this cipher around 58 BC, ensuring that even if a message was intercepted, it could not be understood by enemies. Although it offers minimal security by modern standards, the Caesar Cipher laid the foundation for more advanced encryption methods used today.

Vernam Cipher
The Vernam Cipher, also known as the One-Time Pad (OTP), is a cryptographic technique that offers perfect secrecy when implemented under strict conditions. It encrypts plaintext using a key that is truly random, of the same length as the message, and used only once. Each character is encrypted using a bitwise XOR operation, making the algorithm both simple and resistant to pattern recognition. When these conditions are met, the cipher is theoretically unbreakable, as the ciphertext reveals no information about the original message. This level of security makes it ideal for highly sensitive communications, and its simplicity is a strength in environments where computational efficiency is needed.
However, the Vernam Cipher faces significant practical challenges, primarily related to key management. Generating, distributing, and securely storing large, random keys for every message is difficult and limits its scalability. Reusing keys undermines security, potentially exposing the original messages through cryptanalysis. While ideal in theory, the cipher is inefficient for long messages or widespread use, especially when compared to modern symmetric encryption methods that use shorter, reusable keys. Despite these drawbacks, the Vernam Cipher remains a foundational concept in cryptography and is still used in specific scenarios requiring absolute confidentiality.

MD5 and SHA-256 hashing

MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used hash function that generates a 128-bit hash value. Originally intended for cryptographic security, MD5 is now considered insecure due to known vulnerabilities that allow for collisions (two different inputs producing the same hash). While it is no longer suitable for secure cryptographic applications, MD5 can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity against accidental errors, but not for protection against intentional tampering.

MD5 had two main usages over the past decades:
Hash function: at the beginning of the Internet, it was often the default choice to store passwords in a database. This is no longer a good idea, for security reasons.
Checksum: MD5 is a good candidate to quickly check file integrity after a transfer. By using it as a checksum, we can assure that the file on both side is the same.

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function that belongs to the SHA-2 family, developed by the NSA and published by NIST in 2001. It was introduced as a more secure alternative to SHA-1, which had become increasingly vulnerable to brute-force attacks. The "256" in SHA-256 refers to the fixed length of the output hash—256 bits (32 bytes)—regardless of the size of the input data. This consistency makes SHA-256 reliable for ensuring data integrity, as even a tiny change in the input results in a completely different hash.
One of the key characteristics of SHA-256 is its digest length, which is always 256 bits, aligning with its name. It also has the property of irreversibility, meaning that it is computationally infeasible to reverse the hash to obtain the original plaintext. This one-way nature makes SHA-256 highly secure for applications like digital signatures, password storage, and blockchain technology. Additionally, it is resistant to collisions (two different inputs producing the same hash), which adds to its robustness in cryptographic systems.
MD5 and SHA-256 are both cryptographic hash algorithms commonly used to store sensitive data like passwords, but SHA-256 is generally considered superior due to its larger output size (256 bits vs. 128 bits) and much lower risk of collisions, making it more secure. While SHA-256 is slightly slower than MD5, the difference in performance is minimal and does not outweigh the significant security benefits. Therefore, for modern applications where data integrity and security are critical, SHA-256 is the preferred choice over MD5.

Vigenere cipher
The Vigenère Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text that uses a form of polyalphabetic substitution, meaning it applies multiple substitution alphabets to the plaintext. Unlike simple substitution ciphers that use a single alphabet, the Vigenère Cipher employs the Vigenère table, also known as the Vigenère square, which contains 26 rows of the alphabet, each row shifted one position to the left from the previous. During encryption, the cipher selects a different row of the table based on a repeating keyword, with each letter of the keyword determining which alphabet row to use for the corresponding character in the plaintext. This approach increases security by obscuring letter frequency patterns, making the cipher more resistant to traditional frequency analysis compared to monoalphabetic ciphers like Caesar Cipher.


SHA-Hashing
SHA (Secure Hashing Algorithm) is a cryptographic function used to hash data and digital certificates by transforming input data into a fixed-size, unreadable format using techniques like bitwise operations, modular additions, and compression functions. It is an improvement over MD5 and is designed to ensure data integrity. Unlike encryption, hashing is a one-way process, meaning the original data cannot be retrieved from the hash, making it secure against reverse engineering—except through brute force attacks. One of the key properties of SHA is its sensitivity to input changes: even a small change, such as altering the case of a single letter, will produce a completely different hash, ensuring the uniqueness and integrity of the hashed data.
