• Introduction: 
Protecting personal information from unauthorized access has become increasingly important as the world grows more digitally connected. Cryptography plays a critical role in achieving this goal by ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of digital data. From securing stored information to protecting online communications, cryptographic techniques are essential for maintaining trust and security in today's digital environment.

Cryptography enables secure communication by using algorithms to transform readable data into an unreadable format, which can only be reverted by authorized parties. It underpins a wide range of everyday applications, including secure messaging, email encryption, digital signatures, and online banking. As such, professionals working in cybersecurity, software development, and IT infrastructure must possess both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in cryptographic methods.

This project aims to provide a hands-on, interactive platform for learning and experimenting with commonly used cryptographic algorithms. The purpose is to build a user-friendly application developed using Streamlit that allows users to perform encryption, decryption, and hashing on real-world data. By integrating multiple cryptographic tools into a single, accessible interface, the project seeks to enhance users’ understanding of core concepts such as symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, and secure key exchange. This practical approach not only supports academic learning but also prepares users for real-life applications in the field of information security.

• Project Objectives: 
The objective of this project is to design and build an interactive, user-friendly application that demonstrates the use of core cryptographic techniques. The specific goals include:

Implement core cryptographic algorithms including symmetric, asymmetric, and hashing techniques for securing text and files.


Develop an intuitive user interface using Streamlit to allow easy access to encryption, decryption, and hashing functions.


Ensure secure data processing for confidentiality, integrity verification, and password protection.

• Discussions:
o Describe the overall application architecture and UI choice.
o For each implemented cryptographic algorithm:
▪ Name and type (Symmetric/Asymmetric/Hash)
▪ Brief history/background

▪ Description of the process/how it works (can be high-level
or include simplified pseudocode)
▪ Libraries used for its implementation
▪ How it's integrated into your application
